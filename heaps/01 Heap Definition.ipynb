    "\n",
    "2) Must be a complete tree! This means that **All** levels are completely filled from left to right, expet the very last level that is not needed to be full! Look at the picture below;\n",

    "3) A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the value value at **root** must be minimum among **all values** present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is essencially the same, but the root node is the Maximum value among all the present nodes! Below is an example of Binary Min Heap. \n",
