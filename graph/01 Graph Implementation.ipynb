    "# Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph is a non-linear DS which is basically a collection of Nodes(Vertices) and Edges where the edges can be directed (one way street), or Undirected (2-way street). The difference between a graph and a tree is that a graph Can have a cycle in itself! Meaning in a graph we can return back to one node on on and on!\n",

    "## Why we need Graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph has so many usage in showing a network among different things. Another very well-known use of it is for finding the paths from one city to another one!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph implelentation?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of implementing Graph;\n",
    "- **Adjancy Matrix**\n",
    "- **Adjancy List** ---> using Dictionary in Python\n",

    "![graph](./img/graphimp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use either of the approches?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have few number of Edges, then List would definitely be a good to go option. However, if we have compelete/Almost complete graph (we have maximum number of vertices in the graph), then its good to go for the Matrix approach!\n"
